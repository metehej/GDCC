# General info
GDCCore is a library combining 3 modules of a console app with a GUI - Graphics, Debugging and Control.
Graphics part of this contains elements like buttons, textboxes, scrollbars (not yet) etc. It also has some pre-programmed layouts like Menu, PopUp, etc.
Debugging part is the heart of the library and is supposed to be the heart of your program as its meant to be run as the main task. It collects all keyboard input and handles it as necessary. It contains a "console", single line command input thats available even when other threads freeze. It is possible to define your own commands as they sit in a separate file.
Control part takes all keyboard input and handles it. It allows movement across buttons, text entering, debug input etc.

Its a rather simple library and i hope to make using it even simpler by time. Documentation pending, but code is commented.
